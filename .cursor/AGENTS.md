- Specify the format or style you prefer for the output

### Agent Coordination

- Agents can work together on complex tasks
- Mention multiple agents if you need combined expertise
- Use the studio producer agent for project coordination
- Let agents know when they should collaborate vs. work independently

## Agent Model Assignments

Different agents use different AI models based on their complexity and requirements:

- **High-tier models**: Complex reasoning, research, and strategic tasks
- **Medium-tier models**: Standard development and analysis tasks
- **Light models**: Simple tasks, quick responses, and routine work

Model assignments are configured in `models.json` and automatically managed by the system.
