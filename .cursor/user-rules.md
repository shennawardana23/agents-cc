# User Rules for AI Agent Interaction

Comprehensive guidelines for interacting with AI agents in the Arcipelago International studio system. These rules ensure effective communication, proper agent activation, and successful collaboration, especially in custom scenarios without attached documentation.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

### **Agent-First Communication**

- **Clear Intent**: Always express what you want to accomplish before providing details
- **Context-Aware**: Agents should infer missing information from project context and patterns
- **Proactive Assistance**: Agents should ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- **Documentation Independence**: Agents should work effectively even without attached documentation

### **Custom Scenario Handling**

- **Pattern Recognition**: Use existing project patterns to infer requirements
- **Best Practice Application**: Apply established conventions from similar implementations
- **Clarification Seeking**: Ask targeted questions when context is insufficient
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic implementation and iterate based on feedback

## Agent Interaction Guidelines

### How to Activate Agents

1. **Direct Mention**: Use `@agent-name` followed by your request

   ```markdown
   @ux-researcher, please conduct a user interview for our new feature
   ```

2. **Expertise Description**: Describe what you need without mentioning a specific agent

   ```markdown
   I need help analyzing user feedback and prioritizing features for the next sprint
   ```

3. **Task-Based Requests**: Clearly describe the task and let agents self-select

   ```markdown
   Create a component that allows users to upload and preview images
   ```

4. **Custom Scenario Request**: For complex implementations without documentation

   ```markdown
   I have a complex business logic requirement that needs to integrate with our existing user management system. The current implementation uses JWT tokens and PostgreSQL. Please implement this following our established patterns.
   ```

### Communication Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Clearly describe what you want to accomplish
- **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
- **Set Expectations**: Mention deadlines, priorities, or constraints
- **Request Format**: Specify if you need code, documentation, analysis, or research
- **Ask Questions**: If something is unclear, ask for clarification

#### **Custom Scenario Communication**

When working without attached documentation:

1. **Describe Current State**

   ```markdown
   We're building on our existing e-commerce platform that uses:
   - React frontend with TypeScript
   - Go backend with Clean Architecture
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Redis for caching
   ```

2. **Specify Integration Points**

   ```markdown
   This needs to integrate with our existing user authentication system and payment processing module
   ```

3. **Define Success Criteria**

   ```markdown
   The implementation should handle 1000 concurrent users and process transactions within 2 seconds
   ```

4. **Mention Constraints**

   ```markdown
   Must work within our existing error handling patterns and logging system
   ```
