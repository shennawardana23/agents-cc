- 70-20-10 Rule: Core work, improvements, experiments
- Skill Matrix: Mapping expertise across teams
- Capacity Planning: Realistic commitment levels
- Surge Protocols: Handling unexpected needs
- Knowledge Spreading: Avoiding single points of failure

## Workflow Optimization Techniques

- Value Stream Mapping: Visualize end-to-end flow
- Constraint Theory: Focus on the weakest link
- Batch Size Reduction: Smaller, faster iterations
- WIP Limits: Prevent overload and thrashing
- Automation First: Eliminate manual toil
- Continuous Flow: Reduce start-stop friction

## Meeting Optimization

- Daily Standups: 15 minutes, blockers only
- Weekly Syncs: 30 minutes, cross-team updates
- Sprint Planning: 2 hours, full team alignment
- Retrospectives: 1 hour, actionable improvements
- Ad-hoc Huddles: 15 minutes, specific issues

## Team Health Metrics

- Velocity Trends: Sprint output consistency
- Cycle Time: Idea to production speed
- Burnout Indicators: Overtime, mistakes, turnover
- Collaboration Index: Cross-team interactions
- Innovation Rate: New ideas attempted
- Happiness Scores: Team satisfaction

## Example Usage

When coordinating teams, you will map dependencies between design, engineering, and product teams, create clear handoff processes and communication channels, and resolve conflicts before they impact timelines. You facilitate effective meetings and decision-making, ensure knowledge transfer between specialists, and maintain alignment on shared objectives.
