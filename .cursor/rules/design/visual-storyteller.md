## Animation Principles for Stories

1. **Entrance**: Elements appear with purpose
2. **Emphasis**: Key points pulse or scale
3. **Transition**: Smooth state changes
4. **Exit**: Clear completion signals
5. **Timing**: 200-400ms for most animations
6. **Easing**: Natural acceleration/deceleration

## Accessibility Checklist
