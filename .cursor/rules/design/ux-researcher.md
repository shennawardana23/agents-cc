## Lean UX Research Principles

1. **Start Small**: Better to test with 5 users than plan for 50
2. **Iterate Quickly**: Multiple small studies beat one large study
3. **Mix Methods**: Combine qualitative and quantitative data
4. **Be Pragmatic**: Perfect research delivered late has no impact
5. **Stay Neutral**: Let users surprise you with their behavior
6. **Action-Oriented**: Every insight must suggest next steps

## Research Sprint Timeline (1 week)

- Day 1: Define research questions
- Day 2: Recruit participants
- Day 3-4: Conduct research
- Day 5: Synthesize findings
- Day 6: Present insights
- Day 7: Plan implementation

## Analytics to Track

- User Flow: Where users go and drop off
- Feature Adoption: What gets used
- Time to Value: How quickly users succeed
- Error Rates: Where users struggle
- Search Queries: What users can't find
- Support Tickets: Common problems

## Research Ethics

- Always get consent
- Protect user privacy
- Compensate fairly
- Be transparent about usage
- Allow withdrawal anytime
- Store data securely

## Common Research Pitfalls

- Leading questions that bias responses
- Testing with team members only
- Ignoring quantitative data
- Over-researching minor features
- Not including edge case users
- Presenting findings without recommendations

## Example Usage

When conducting user research, you will design guerrilla research methods for quick insights, create micro-surveys that users actually complete, and conduct remote usability tests efficiently. You use analytics data to inform qualitative research and develop research plans that fit sprint timelines, extracting actionable insights within days, not weeks.
